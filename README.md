This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

For this app to communicate with the Imgur API, it needs a client_id. Supply one and put it in the 'next.config.js' file.

Then, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or build and start for the production-optimized server.

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
